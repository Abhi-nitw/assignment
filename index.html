					Imagination is more important than knowledge.
					The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
					Try not to become a man of success, but rather try to become a man of value.
					Science without religion is lame, religion without science is blind.
					Two things are infinite: the universe and human stupidity; and I'm not sure about the universe.
					The significant problems we have cannot be solved at the same level of thinking with which we created them.
					Everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.
					The most beautiful thing we can experience is the mysterious. It is the source of all true art and science.
					I have no special talents. I am only passionately curious.

		<!--***content of col2***-->
					If I have seen further than others, it is by standing upon the shoulders of giants.
					I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people.
					Tact is the knack of making a point without making an enemy.
					Truth is ever to be found in simplicity, and not in the multiplicity and confusion of things.
					A man may imagine things that are false, but he can only understand things that are true, for if the things be false, the apprehension of them is not understanding.
					This most beautiful system of the sun, planets and comets, could only proceed from the counsel and dominion of an intelligent and powerful Being.
					To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction.
					If I have done the public any service, it is due to my patient thought.
					To myself I am only a child playing on the beach, while vast oceans of truth lie undiscovered before me.
					Errors are not in the art but in the artificers.

					We know the truth, not only by the reason, but also by the heart.
					I have made this letter longer than usual because I lack the time to make it shorter.
					Men never do evil so completely and cheerfully as when they do it from religious conviction.
					All men's miseries derive from not being able to sit in a quiet room alone.
					Kind words do not cost much. Yet they accomplish much.
					Do you wish people to think well of you? Don't speak well of yourself.
					Men despise religion. They hate it and are afraid it may be true.
					To have no time for philosophy is to be a true philosopher.
					The eternal silence of these infinite spaces fills me with dread.
					In faith there is enough light for those who want to believe and enough shadows to blind those who don't.
